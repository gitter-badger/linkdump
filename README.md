### What is Link Dump

Link Dump is a place where as the name suggests you dump links. It's not built as a social networking service for a reason.
It's built as an addon to your website that you can run preferably as a subdomain.

Sharing links is easy you simply login hit add new and past the link and the website will go out and fetch the title and
other data related and display in a neat organized manner.

Do you want sorting and other nifty features that make browsing and sharing a piece of cake? Who doesn't. Well lucky for you
we have all of that. Including collections that you can name and add any links you want to.
